# ChemLib 1.18.2-2.0.5

- Fix issues 200-201: element classification changed so that elements 72-80 are not marked as Lanthanides. Lanthanides are no longer indicated as radioactive in the periodic table.
- Add copper, iron, and gold dusts/plates. The base game already adds nuggets, ingots, and blocks.
- Add keratin for alchemistry recipes that require it.
